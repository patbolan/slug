Was about to work on reports, but got stuck on some permissions issues
Got those fixed, pushining up.
Then I have to first do fitting, 
then do reports.

Choices:
* do one, most likely tool, run_all. Takes a long time, and some parts may break, so I think
they'll want to break it up.
* make tools for all small things and options. run_t2_semc_roi_center. Nice part about that 
is you can do inputs/outputs fine. Lots of tools. Could maybe use one configurable class
* Do both of the above. Typically run the big tool, but you have option to run all little 
tools with all possible options. Or, put them all in there, and have an "order" field. Like 
1, 2, 3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, etc. I like this because you can track the file/folder requirements
for each little step
* A configureable tool. Dropdown on first page, or a 2nd page. Make the fitting a separate 
table, so you have slice/VOI controls different for each. I don't like this complexity, too
much getting into the GUI. 


OK, i implemented run_all_fits. Since I can't tell if it can run or has run, I don't have 
the process id listed. And I can't tell about errors. I think I want a version that
has --undo at the command line


***
For this test case, let's run all first on command line
PXX-0001/MR-20250304

t2_tse
t2_semc
t1_vfa
t1_tse
t1_tse (with tfls?)
t1_tse (with _smart?)
dwi_source
b1map


./run_t2_tse.sh -i /home/bakken-raid8/pcad2/data_dev/PXX-0001/MR-20250304 -t t2_tse -s both -f both
outputs: t2_tse folder, ROI_stats/t2_tse*
same for t2_semc




./run_t2_semc.sh -i "/home/bakken-raid8/pcad2/data_dev/PXX-0001/MR-20250505" -t "t2_semc"
needs t2_semc_mask.nii
produces folder t2_semc
-s [whole, middle, both]
-f [ROI, Voxel, both]

params.txt has a timestamp. If you run whole,
Can't get archive working


Same with run_t2_tse


Or, run_all_fits study folder
