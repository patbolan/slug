Major revision of the tools/modules/processes
First, let's get the new module structure to look at the correct folder. 
Implement only nii_converter first

A few ideas
X get the nii-converter code updated - CHECK
* subject types are human, phantom, Study types are human-mri, phantom-mri


Lots of stuff. Need a new tool base, module_base. You give it a name, and pass in 
default options. 

Actually, at startup it should load the CSV files to get a list of modules. Then for 
each, try to call get_proprties, and save all that info. Some commands will not be 
available.

When you are loading eg a study page, figure out the type, get the list of all possible
modules to display. Create an object for each. That constructor will call commandline
status. Thos results will be packaged up as needed for the GUI, along with PIDs if 
possible. 

Need to test options in the GUI

Then if you click run or undo. That object is re-constructed, and executed.

Consider modifying the saved PID folders. Name them as PID_modulename_targetname. 
Then it will be way easier to look at those logs to see what's beenrun

It loads the CSV file (should do this once) and gets the folder and script name
Calls properites 

Proably need a separate route to list the modules that are avilablle. You can 
"test" each one, to get status, properties.


Then go back and pull your python code out into modules (autotag, parse_dicom)
