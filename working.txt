Handling of all text files is now the same

NOPE! Thought it was working, but it was really using subject and variable path

Need more distinct routes:
/viewer/subjects/<subject_name>/studies/<study_name>/files/<path:file_relative_path>
/viewer/subjects/<subject_name>/files/<path:file_relative_path>


TODO:
* get NIFTIs back online
* Click on the DICOMs series. 
* extract some dicom header information in the study page
