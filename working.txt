Got a lot of this working well. Next steps

* DICOM Header metadata
* DICOM table (does this go into collections page?)
* Separate out source and generated collections? dicom-raw and dicom-original should be first
* get rid of collections
* Unify your text editing for json, .txt, csv


Need to figure out collections. They can contain files, or folders with files. Should I define these as items? This is why Flywheel zipped them up, to avoid another level of hierarchy. 

Another approach would be to not have collections, but under a study there are just file hierarchies. 
I do want to handle some specially. Like, if there is a dicom-original, or Reports, or T1map/Reports.
Maybe this is the simple way - you can view the file hierarchy directly. Then you would also have 
special handlers for some files, or folder/files, directly. So you could see the file dicom_tags.csv, 
but also have a special function to view/edit them. 

For now, I'll not abstract these.
