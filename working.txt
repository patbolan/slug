Later need to break up app.py. One other file for file handling (text, dicom) and one for tools

nii-converter looks complete. However, I see that some studies make additional "mask" files in nii-original. 
That's not right - shouldn't be callled original.

Processes are now ALL asycnrhonous. They can be quick, that's fine. 

X dicom-raw converter
X Autotag
registration module
reports

I think I can generalize tools a little more. Like make a version that handles modules. Look at the LONI structure to make that more consistent.
Also I have a process running in a process. Might be better to reduce one layer - just run that subprocess and attach? If possible.

Need to clean up the process stuff too. Lots of seraching. Maybe need a datastructure you build on the fly.


BUGS:
* back button while editing study notes.txt fails.

ALSO
* move the code to pcad2
* lots of refactoring


TODO:
* Autotag
* Pipeline steps
