Later need to break up app.py. One other file for file handling (text, dicom) and one for tools

I think I can generalize tools a little more. Like make a version that handles modules. Look at the LONI structure to make that more consistent.
Also I have a process running in a process. Might be better to reduce one layer - just run that subprocess and attach? If possible.

Need to clean up the process stuff too. Lots of seraching. Maybe need a datastructure you build on the fly.
