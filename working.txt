Later need to break up app.py. One other file for file handling (text, dicom) and one for tools

nii-converter looks complete. However, I see that some studies make additional "mask" files in nii-original. 
That's not right - shouldn't be callled original.

Next Tool steps:
* re-implement nii-coverter. Then refactor up to Tool
* Prepare a second tool. I think the dicom-raw converter
* document up the tools a bit. Four states. 
* reports


ALSO
* move the code to pcad2
* lots of refactoring


TODO:
* Autotag
* Pipeline steps
